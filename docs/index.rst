Introduction
============

The Full-sun Ultraviolet Rocket Spectrometer (FURST) is a NASA sounding rocket
mission designed to measure the full-disk spectrum of the Sun in the far
ultraviolet spectral range (120 - 180 nm) with high spectral resolution, :math:`R > 20,000`.
FURST is a Rowland circle spectrograph :cite:p:`Rowland1882` which is designed
to minimize the number of optical surfaces, and provides the maximum possible
throughput in the ultraviolet.

This package provides an idealized model of the FURST optical system which is
designed to be used by the FURST data reduction pipeline.
